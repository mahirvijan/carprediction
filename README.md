cars have always mesmerised me ,so i build a web app using flask and heruko.


methodology

1)collection the dataset.
2) doing exploratory data analysis on the given data .
3) building a regression based model to find out the car price.
4) made a pickle of the model and stored it in a pickle file.
5) built a web app using flask and did some front end using html and css to it.
